> Created this repo for my summer programming challenge. Contains various little projects, the goal was to finish each of them in a day to master problem solving and enhance my Javascript skills. I used YouTube tutorials to get project ideas. Whenever I got stuck or didn't understand why the code wasn't working, I turned to these videos for help. I learned a lot in the process.
